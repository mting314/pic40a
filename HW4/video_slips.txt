5:52 "...entirely of alphanumeric characters in here"
     --> "...entirely of alphanumeric characters or characters from here"

7:14 "plus equals"
     I'm too used to saying that from teaching "+=";
     I meant to say "plus minus"; Â± is a much stranger character.


RegEx hint...
Make sure to use ^ and $.
^ specifies that the match should be found at the start of the string.
$ specifies that the match should be found at the end of the string.
Together, they will make sure you get a total match.
