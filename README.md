# PIC 40A

My homeworks and final project for UCLA's [PIC 40A](https://www.pic.ucla.edu/~mjandr/40A.html) class with Professor Michael Andrews taken in Fall 2020.

> Introduction to core technologies of Internet, with focus on client-side Web programming. Fundamental protocols, static Web pages, Perl language, Common Gateway Interface, XML. P/NP or letter grading.

Most of the homeworks consist of actually building up to the final project, a web version of [Shut The Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_box). The game itself was implemented in JavaScript, and the login was implemented in PHP, the welcome page remembers your login for an hour thanks to cookies, and the scores submissions and leaderboard automatic updates were implemented with AJAX requests.

- **Homework 1:** A basic website about a favorite artist meant to introduce HTML.

- **Homework 2:** An introduction to JavaScript, the foundation for functions of the actual Shut The Box game later.

- **Homework 3:** Implementing the previous JS into a webpage so that a user can actually play Shut The Box.

- **Homework 4:** A basic login page that uses cookies to remember your login for an hour, and checks if your username uses valid characters with appropriate warning.

- **Homework 5:** Not as related to the Shut The Box game, but an introduction to PHP. Making an evil website that looks like the normal website
