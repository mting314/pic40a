        <h3>
          Early Life
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lil Pump was born in Florida. I don't know too much else about his early life. However, I do know that he was
          kicked
          out of high school for starting a fight. I bet he did a lot of drugs and stuff though.</p>
        <h3>
          Start of Musical Career
        </h3>
        <p>At some point, Lil Pump enrolled in Harverd University, being the genus that he is. However, in an act of
          true selflessness, he dropped out to save the rap game. Thus, he has adopted the monker of the "Harverd
          Dropout".</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I really like Lil Pump's music. Here is a list of some of masterpieces that I like the most, ordered in
          decreasing number of unique words.</p>

        In fact, I like Lil Pump's lyrics so much that one of the first things I tried when exploring machine learning
        was a
        model to generate more Lil Pump lyrics when I memorized them all. There is a small sampling:
        <ul>
          <li>
            soo icy I get soo much money, my chain is so icy
          </li>

          </li>
        </ul>
