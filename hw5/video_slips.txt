At 1:41, I mean that I typed "myPassw0rd".

At 4:19 - "common" --> "the same".

At 8:47 and 12:46 - apparently, I forgot how to say "mischievous".

14:37 - "interested" --> "interesting".

16:37 - "HTML" --> "PHP".

20:00 - "...it could even be the welcome page."

24:45 - "should happen" --> "is possible".
